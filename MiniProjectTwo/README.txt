Task:
- Using the given data files, indices were constructed. 
- In this project, programs were written to keep data in files and maintain
  indices that provide basic searches over data.
- Indices are created in Phase 1 and 2 which are then used to process queries
  in Phase 3 of the project.
- Files are created in Phase 1 and are used to construct indices in Phase 2. 
  Following this, queries are written and processed based upon user inputs. 

Running the program:
The program can be run using terminal and 
typing in following commands for respective phases of the project:
-    Phase 1: python3 PrepareFiles.py xml_file_name.xml
-    Phase 2: sh LoadFiles.sh
-    Phase 3: python3 Main.py
For Phase 3, DBMS.py file has the code for all the queries and functions which are called in Main.py 
to process the queries. 
On running Phase 3, the user will be prompted to follow or run commands to perform queries or exit the system.
