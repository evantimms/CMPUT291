- I think you are missing your arrows for the many to one relationships
- I think you are also missing the thick lines for many-to-many relationships

- Not sure why registration is in another 3-way relationship with ticket, would you be able
to explain your thinking behind that one?
- I don't think you need to make seperate objects for mother/father/partner1/partner2. I think you
can use a relationship to represent them but your way works too I believe.

- How are you distinguishing that a birth must have a mother but the father is 
  optional?
- Having mother/father as a relationship could make sense, however the diagram 
  should still indicate that a mother or father could are also people. I don't 
  belive relationships can exist in a "Is-A" relationship with another entity.
- Same as above, but for partner 1, partner 2
- Demerit entity lacks a primary key and appears to be drawn as a strong entity,
- has_demerit should indicate there must be one and only one driver for that 
  demerit (similar to ticket issued to a vehicle)

- Initially, I disagreed with having person 'has' birth_certification which also 
  'has' a mother and 'has' a father. However, I think in retrospect this is the 
  right way and I will have to update mine for the group. I think its the only 
  way to represent that mother is not optional but father is.
- Are you sure that License class is a weak entity? I can see license classes 
  existing without anyone holding those licenses yet. Further, "id" seems like 
  it could uniquely identify a license class.
- I would agree demerit_notice is dependent on the driver, though.
- I initially didn't think it would make sense to have ticket related 
  to both registration and driver, however on rereading the assignment it does 
  say twice it must be a registered vehicle. I will suggest your version for the 
  gorup project

- You have partner 1 and partner 2 as entities that are related together by the relationship "married", 
however, I think you should have also showed that there is participationa constraints there. Same for 
mother in "born" relationship.
- Some other relationships are also missing arrows and bold lines to specify many-to-one relations and 
participation constraints. For instance, License class and driver's license, tickets and traffic officer.
- Overall, neat diagram and thanks for suggesting a software to allow for collaboration on ER diagrams.

- The way you have directly referenced mother. father, partner 1 and partner to person makes sense in terms 
of relationships, I am not totally sure how this will get translated to tables but it surely reduces redundancy.
- You have only related ticket to vehicle, which may or may not be registered. Based on my understanding,
a ticket can be issued to a registred vehicle and therefore, there should be a ternary relationship between 
tickets, vehicle and registration. This is also the reasoning behind the question in your comment for me.
- Other than that, your ER diagram very-well captured all the details of the description.
